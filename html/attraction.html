  The movie career of Charlie Chaplin began in 1913 and he had the longest most versatile career in the history of movies. 
  His movies continue to be enjoyed by youngsters in age and mind to this day.</p>

  sea fishing location. Fully licensed boats are available, taking parties of Anglers. There are many excellent locations for shore angling (maps available on request). Rods & Reels for hire.</p>
